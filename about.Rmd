| Why biology?                  | I have always been passionate about life and the living. Animals,the way our body works, the evolution of our Earth fascinate me. I study biology to become a marine zoologist                       |
| Why did I chose this topic?                | The birds were the first animals to which I paid attention. I have always observed them in my garden. When I heard about this decline I wanted to work on it to better understand the situation and maybe even find a solution because it is true that even if the study is based in North America, I  have myself observed a decrease in common birds in my neighborhood as the years go by.                                                       |
