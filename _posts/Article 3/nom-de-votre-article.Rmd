| General topic?               | Native birds from Australia are disappearing because of the urbanisation, the destruction of the wildlife. --> Because of the **habitat loss**. |
| Procedure/what was examined? | **Urbanization** and **urban development** destroy vegetation and many natural habitats. --> These destructions affect species (**extinction**) --> Scientists have developed a **loss index** to indicate how habitat loss affects Australian birds --> Many birds not recognized as being in danger have **disappeared** --> Scientists have noticed that even removing *one hectare* has a big negative impact on birds. --> This *loss index* allow them to compare different groups in front of habitat loss --> They used the **Living Planet Index** to compare these lost around the world. --> Big problem in the health of ecosystem. --> Common species are in big **danger**. --> We can not wait, otherwise these species will disappear under our eyes. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | Across Australia, **+60%** of 262 native birds have lost their habitat according to the *Loss Index*. They recorded that **52%** of birds in this country have declined since 1985 to 2015. + *The Living Planet Index* noticed that that more than **4000 birds** have decreased by more than half since 1970. **Parrots** are the most struck. --> Big link between habitat loss and decrease of population of birds. |
