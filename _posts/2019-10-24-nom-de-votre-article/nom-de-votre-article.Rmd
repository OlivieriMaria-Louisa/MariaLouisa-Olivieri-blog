| General Topic                | One of the causes of bird declines in North America is global warming. |
| Procedure/what was examined? | K.Rosenberg has released an alarming report regarding the loss of 3 million birds in North America. --> Researchers B.Baterman & M.Parr have done a study linking global warming to these losses. --> Output of a report predicts the loss of 600 birds (400 species) if the temperature increases from 1.5 to 3 degrees celcius. --> Global warming makes the situation worse. --> Explanation of the gravity of the subject. --> We can still save the situation by making great efforts. --> If nothing is done to reduce the warming, the birds will disappear. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | Global warming threatens two-thirds of the birds of North America (about 600 species). There is a big risk of extinction. |
| Remaining questions?         | If nobody settles the situation, will global warming lead to total extinction of common birds? |
