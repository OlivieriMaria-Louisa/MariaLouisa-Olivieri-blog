| General Topic                | The impact of Australia's bushfires on birds’ breeding behavior
| Procedure/what was examined? | He has been working since 1992 on **ecological impacts** on the reproduction of birds --> Every year he goes to Australia to watch for **bird nests** --> This year there were only **250** nests out of the **800**, and they were not affected by the fire --> Consequence of the **heat** and **dry** conditions --> If it's too hot, there are fewer insects, so less reproduction of birds --> Bird populations are **ecological indicators**, their decline is synonymous with ecological danger.
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The fires have an indirect impact on the reproduction of birds, it is not the biggest problem. The worst are the too **dry conditions**, When this happens, birds don't breed. |
| Remaining questions?         | / |
