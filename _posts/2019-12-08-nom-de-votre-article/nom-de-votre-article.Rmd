| Researchers                  | --> *David Willard*: ornithologist of the Field Museum in Chicago. He has collected bird samples for **40 years** |
| Published in?                | 07 December 2019 |
| General topic                | Collection of samples of birds (40 years ) who killed themselves in Chicago (buildings, etc.) in order to observe ***the morphology**. |
| Procedure/what was examined? | *D.Williard* collected samples to avoid waste ( **70000** migratory bird specimens in his collection). --> At first, he didn't know that his samples were conducting a climate change study. (avoid waste) --> He observed that common birds have **shrunk**. --> Link between the increase of temperature in Chicago ( **+1.8F**) and the changing of bird bodies. --> Similar observations has been done in marine animals. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | Bird bodies have shrunk for 40 years and their wings are growing. This phenomenon may be due to the increase in temperatures. |
| Remaining questions?         | Is it sure that this discovery is due to global warming? What is the impact for humans? |
